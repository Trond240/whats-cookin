# What's that Smell'? 

## Project Goals and Objectives

- Follow the specification below to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and     mehtods
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

## Project OverView

In this project we wanted to create a recipe tracking/ meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes. A user should be able to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook, and make a shooping list based on those recipes.
