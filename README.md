## Project OverView

In this project we wanted to create a recipe tracking/ meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes. A user should be able to view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook, and make a shooping list based on those recipes. 

## How to open our app. 

1. open your terminal- command + space => terminal

2. cd into the file- cd => fileName/src

3. in your terminal- open the html doc => open index.html
